Flexible numeric parsers for real-world programming languages. These parsers accept values such as `100_000_000`, `0B1_1`, and `0xa_bcd_ef0`.

This code was extracted from the [Semantic](http://github.com/github/semantic/) project.

Currently missing support for complex numbers and hexadecimal floats. If you need the former, hit me up on Twitter; if you need the latter, then I sure want to know what your use case is.
